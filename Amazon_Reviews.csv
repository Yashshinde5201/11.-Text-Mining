Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality, feels premium. Software experience has been good so far no bugs, smooth UI. The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup, it doesn't last whole day. Gives about 6-7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data. Battery performance could have been better as Samsung's mid-range phones are really good at battery backup. When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over-saturated, night mode pics are not that great feels over-exposed almost all the time.

Â The battery backup is very poor at present. Tried tweaking multiple things including changing the performance profile to ""Light"" instead of ""Standard"". That seems to help a bit. But, it's nowhere near the 7-8 hours of screen on time reported in most Youtube reviews and user experience.My old device was a Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro, which I exchanged for this. It had more than 100 apps installed and even with that the battery was pretty good. In this phone I have installed only a very few apps until now, so very surprised by the battery life.Many online forums including Samsung Members app have multiple reports of the same. Seems like its after the Feb 2023 update, hope it'll be fixed in their next update.(fingers crossed)Other than that it has been a very satisfying and really good experience with butter smooth animations and quick app loading, awesome screen and multimedia content from apps like Netflix is a treat to watch on it. And the ""Expert raw"" app is a beast at grabbing unprecedented level of detailing. Even if I use jpg output from it, it's still far ahead than the regular Camera app in it. However, the default camera app is also pretty solid. The camera images and videos in low light is pretty good.Another thing I liked is that most of the Samsung apps(that comes by default) which is not needed can be uninstalled.Note: One thing I learnt the hard way: If you're applying a screen guard/tempered glass afterwards, do register your fingerprint again for best detection.

2,"Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra 5G (Green, 12GB, 256GB Storage) : Amazon.in: Electronics",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 28 February 2023,The perfect beast,5.0,"This phone is a pefect upgrade from my old One plus. I had to make a hard choice between s22 and s23. I came to the conclusion that processor used in s22 (Snapdragon 8 gen 1) is inefficient. Infact it was one of the most inefficient processors produced by snapdragon+samsung in last 5 years in premium segment. That combined with low battery was just worse. So I decided to spend more money for this phone. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is an actual successor of snapdragon and gives enormous battery life.After first charge, I was getting 8 hours SOT. Which is double from my old Oppo Oneplus (Haha). Plus I got upgrade on the first day, using 120 hz refresh rate with light performance mode while battery set to adaptive. I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby digital mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing things is the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22. Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazedinc.com tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around â‚¹675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.

Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality, feels premium. Software experience has been good so far no bugs, smooth UI. The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup, it doesn't last whole day. Gives about 6-7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data. Battery performance could have been better as Samsung's mid-range phones are really good at battery backup. When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over-saturated, night mode pics are not that great feels over-exposed almost all the time.

I had to make a hard choice between s22 and s23. I came to the conclusion that processor used in s22 (Snapdragon 8 gen 1) is inefficient. Infact it was one of the most inefficient processors produced by snapdragon+samsung in last 5 years in premium segment. That combined with low battery was just worse. So I decided to spend more money for this phone. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is an actual successor of snapdragon and gives enormous battery life.After first charge, I was getting 8 hours SOT. Which is double from my old Oppo Oneplus (Haha). Plus I got upgrade on the first day, using 120 hz refresh rate with light performance mode while battery set to adaptive. I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby digital mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing things is the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22. Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazedinc.com tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around â‚¹675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.

I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby digital mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing things is the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22. Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazedinc.com tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around â‚¹675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.

Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality, feels premium. Software experience has been good so far no bugs, smooth UI. The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup, it doesn't last whole day. Gives about 6-7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data. Battery performance could have been better as Samsung's mid-range phones are really good at battery backup. When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over-saturated, night mode pics are not that great feels over-exposed almost all the time.

I had to make a hard choice between s22 and s23. I came to the conclusion that processor used in s22 (Snapdragon 8 gen 1) is inefficient. Infact it was one of the most inefficient processors produced by snapdragon+samsung in last 5 years in premium segment. That combined with low battery was just worse. So I decided to spend more money for this phone. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is an actual successor of snapdragon and gives enormous battery life.After first charge, I was getting 8 hours SOT. Which is double from my old Oppo Oneplus (Haha). Plus I got upgrade on the first day, using 120 hz refresh rate with light performance mode while battery set to adaptive. I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby digital mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing things is the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22. Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazedinc.com tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around â‚¹675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.

Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality, feels premium. Software experience has been good so far no bugs, smooth UI. The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup, it doesn't last whole day. Gives about 6-7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data. Battery performance could have been better as Samsung's mid-range phones are really good at battery backup. When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over-saturated, night mode pics are not that great feels over-exposed almost all the time.

I had to make a hard choice between s22 and s23. I came to the conclusion that processor used in s22 (Snapdragon 8 gen 1) is inefficient. Infact it was one of the most inefficient processors produced by snapdragon+samsung in last 5 years in premium segment. That combined with low battery was just worse. So I decided to spend more money for this phone. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is an actual successor of snapdragon and gives enormous battery life.After first charge, I was getting 8 hours SOT. Which is double from my old Oppo Oneplus (Haha). Plus I got upgrade on the first day, using 120 hz refresh rate with light performance mode while battery set to adaptive. I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby digital mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing things is the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22. Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazedinc.com tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around â‚¹675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.

You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass.

I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around â‚¹675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.

Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality, feels premium. Software experience has been good so far no bugs, smooth UI. The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup, it doesn't last whole day. Gives about 6-7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data. Battery performance could have been better as Samsung's mid-range phones are really good at battery backup. When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over-saturated, night mode pics are not that great feels over-exposed almost all the time.

I had to make a hard choice between s22 and s23. I came to the conclusion that processor used in s22 (Snapdragon 8 gen 1) is inefficient. Infact it was one of the most inefficient processors produced by snapdragon+samsung in last 5 years in premium segment. That combined with low battery was just worse. So I decided to spend more money for this phone. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is an actual successor of snapdragon and gives enormous battery life.After first charge, I was getting 8 hours SOT. Which is double from my old Oppo Oneplus (Haha). Plus I got upgrade on the first day, using 120 hz refresh rate with light performance mode while battery set to adaptive. I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby digital mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing things is the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22. Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazedinc.com tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around â‚¹675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.

Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality, feels premium. Software experience has been good so far no bugs, smooth UI. The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup, it doesn't last whole day. Gives about 6-7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data. Battery performance could have been better as Samsung's mid-range phones are really good at battery backup. When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over-saturated, night mode pics are not that great feels over-exposed almost all the time.

Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality, feels premium. Software experience has been good so far no bugs, smooth UI. The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup, it doesn't last whole day. Gives about 6-7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data. Battery performance could have been better as Samsung's mid-range phones are really good at battery backup. When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over-saturated, night mode pics are not that great feels over-exposed almost all the time.

I had to make a hard choice between s22 and s23. I came to the conclusion that processor used in s22 (Snapdragon 8 gen 1) is inefficient. Infact it was one of the most inefficient processors produced by snapdragon+samsung in last 5 years in premium segment. That combined with low battery was just worse. So I decided to spend more money for this phone. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is an actual successor of snapdragon and gives enormous battery life.After first charge, I was getting 8 hours SOT. Which is double from my old Oppo Oneplus (Haha). Plus I got upgrade on the first day, using 120 hz refresh rate with light performance mode while battery set to adaptive. I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby digital mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing things is the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22. Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazedinc.com tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around â‚¹675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.

Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K.

Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality, feels premium. Software experience has been good so far no bugs, smooth UI. The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup, it doesn't last whole day. Gives about 6-7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data. Battery performance could have been better as Samsung's mid-range phones are really good at battery backup. When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over-saturated, night mode pics are not that great feels over-exposed almost all the time.

I had to make a hard choice between s22 and s23. I came to the conclusion that processor used in s22 (Snapdragon 8 gen 1) is inefficient. Infact it was one of the most inefficient processors produced by snapdragon+samsung in last 5 years in premium segment. That combined with low battery was just worse. So I decided to spend more money for this phone. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is an actual successor of snapdragon and gives enormous battery life.After first charge, I was getting 8 hours SOT. Which is double from my old Oppo Oneplus (Haha). Plus I got upgrade on the first day, using 120 hz refresh rate with light performance mode while battery set to adaptive. I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby digital mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing things is the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22. Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazedinc.com tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around â‚¹675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.

Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality, feels premium. Software experience has been good so far no bugs, smooth UI. The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup, it doesn't last whole day. Gives about 6-7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data. Battery performance could have been better as Samsung's mid-range phones are really good at battery backup. When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over-saturated, night mode pics are not that great feels over-exposed almost all the time.

Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality, feels premium. Software experience has been good so far no bugs, smooth UI. The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup, it doesn't last whole day. Gives about 6-7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data. Battery performance could have been better as Samsung's mid-range phones are really good at battery backup. When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over-saturated, night mode pics are not that great feels over-exposed almost all the time.

I had to make a hard choice between s22 and s23. I came to the conclusion that processor used in s22 (Snapdragon 8 gen 1) is inefficient. Infact it was one of the most inefficient processors produced by snapdragon+samsung in last 5 years in premium segment. That combined with low battery was just worse. So I decided to spend more money for this phone. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is an actual successor of snapdragon and gives enormous battery life.After first charge, I was getting 8 hours SOT. Which is double from my old Oppo Oneplus (Haha). Plus I got upgrade on the first day, using 120 hz refresh rate with light performance mode while battery set to adaptive. I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby digital mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing things is the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22. Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazedinc.com tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around â‚¹675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.

Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.

243,"Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra 5G (Green, 12GB, 256GB Storage) : Amazon.in: Electronics",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 13 March 2023,I like it.. but not love it.,4.0,"I bought it a week ago.. i upgraded  from my oneplus 6, I used that phone for 4.5 yrs. I was confused between oneplus 11 and samsung 23, after thoroughly going through reviews from experts. I zeroed on this phone,.. I like the phone no doubt. The haptics are nice and UI is smooth.But i dont know why i m facing connectivity issues in this phone. Being a flagship phone, it should  have better connectivity.. but it sucks..websites do not open, both wifi and mobile networks have some kind of bug. I am unable to use internet, i have to constantlyrefresh and restart my device for better network. I am getting  missed calls alerts via sms although  mobile network shows full strength..I think samsung should look into this. its very irritating. Never faced this issue in my 4.5 yrs old oneplus 6.

Was in dilemma whether to buy Oneplus 11 which was costing around 55k. But got this gadget at 56k with exchange bonus which was icing on the cake.Coming to phone, the battery life is decent . I Get only around 5 hrs SOT /17 hrs  in total till battery life and I have very high usage like excel, chrome, and social media apps. Dont play games , so dont know the performance. But its buttery smooth .Outdoor brightness is exceptional. It is joy to watch videos on this on display.Camera is also excellent with very good portraits and night time shots with 60fps recording .Only con is slow charging , should have given 45 w charging option, 25W is slow and also the battery dies from 5% to 1% within like 5 mins.
